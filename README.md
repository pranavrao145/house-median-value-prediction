# House Median Value Prediction

An investigation into building a prediction model for the Boston Housing
dataset. This investigation was based [this
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset).
The data analysis is similar to the notebook attached to that dataset, 
but the overall hyperparameters for the models that were tried turned out 
to be different, ending up in a different conclusion.
